# Modules are functions that can be used in multiple programs and can be used by calling them in program of need

# Here we import the file that contains the defined funtion and call it in the main program

# Such doing will help in organising programs into manageable blocks with specific functions

import animalSound # This imports the file containing the function

import random # This is a predefined python function. Use will be demonstrated later in the pr


animalSound.dogBark("woof woof woof")# inputs argument in function and dog barks ;)

x = random.randrange(1,100)# This randomly select a number from 1 - 100 and assigns it to the variable x
print(x)
